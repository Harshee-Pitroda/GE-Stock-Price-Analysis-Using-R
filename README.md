<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Stock analysis is a technique used by investors and traders to make purchasing and selling choices. Investors and traders strive to obtain an advantage in the markets by making educated judgments by researching and analyzing previous and current data. In this project, I have analyzed the ‘GE Stock Price’ dataset using the R Programming Language.
